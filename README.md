# Sound Explorer v0.8

Sound Explorer is an exploratory tool for education and entertainment. The
goal of this project is to give users an idea of what the frequency spectrum looks like,
how evolution has encouraged different species to occupy different ranges of the frequency spectrum,
and to showcase a common audio editing tool called a "band-pass".


## Current Stage (v0.8)

This version of the tool is almost in a complete form, with a few TODOS:

1. Add images and attribution info for audio recordings used in this project
2. Add some much needed commenting
3. Mobile testing


## Environment Needs:

At this stage, this app only relies on a couple of libraries:
1. node.js
2. d3-scale


## Running it Yourself:

This needs to be tested, but you should currently be able to run this project by 
cloning the repo, creating and activating an environment with React (nodejs) 
and D3-Scale.


## Thanks!

There will be more documentation to come in future updates.
